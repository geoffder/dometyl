### Switches / Caps
Designed for Choc V1, and tuned with MBK keycaps in mind (though choc cap
dimensions are likely consistent enough that you don't have to worry about
collisions with others).

### Fasteners
This configuration is designed to be low-profile, with bumpon eyelets directly
on the case, in lieu of eyelets for attaching a plate or tenting base.

### MCU mounting
M4 heatset eyelets and case cutouts are included to fit the BastardKB Elite-C
holder.
